--- 
Variables:
1. expense_type--> user input for expesses 
2. amount--> user input for costs 
3. total_expense--> using the reduce function to calculate the total expess
4. highest_expesne--> using reduce function for highst expess
5. lowest_expense--> using reduce function to calc lowest expess
---  
Functions:
1. get_expenses
a. parameters--> expense_type, amount
b. return-->  expenses 
2. analyze_expenses
